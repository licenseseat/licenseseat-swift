### Coding Standards

#### Swift Style Guide

- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer clarity over brevity
- Document public APIs with DocC comments

#### Example:
```swift
/// Validates a license key against the LicenseSeat API
/// - Parameters:
///   - licenseKey: The license key to validate
///   - options: Optional validation parameters
/// - Returns: Validation result containing license status
/// - Throws: `LicenseSeatError` if validation fails
public func validate(
    licenseKey: String,
    options: ValidationOptions? = nil
) async throws -> LicenseValidationResult {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **Mock Network Calls** - Use URLProtocol for network testing
4. **Aim for 80%+ Coverage** - Use `swift test --enable-code-coverage`

### Documentation

- Add DocC comments to all public APIs
- Update README for significant changes
- Include code examples in documentation
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated

### Release Process

1. Update version in appropriate files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a pull request
4. After merge, tag the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
